# Mad Libs Generator

This Mad Libs Generator is a fun and interactive Python program that allows users to create a custom story by filling in blanks with words of their choice. It takes user inputs like adjectives, proper nouns, and verbs to generate a creative and personalized story.

## Features
- **Interactive Input**: Users are prompted to provide different types of words (e.g., proper names, adjectives, nouns) to complete the story.
- **Randomized Storytelling**: The story template is consistent, but the user's choices make every story unique and hilarious.
- **Repeatability**: The program loops and allows you to create up to 10 different stories in one run.

## How It Works
1. The program asks users to input specific types of words (e.g., "Choose a proper name").
2. These inputs are then inserted into a predefined story template.
3. The completed story is displayed, showcasing the user's creativity.
4. The program loops back, letting users create multiple versions of the story.

## Story Template
The generated story is a tour of a fictional university campus.
